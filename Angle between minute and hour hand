# Q - Find the angle between minute hand and hour hand at the given time.

time = input('Enter time in format (HH:MM) : ')

hour = int(time[:2]) # extract hour from given time

main_angle = hour*30 # hour hand moves 30 degrees each hour

minutes = int(time[3:]) # extract minutes from given time

req_angle = abs(main_angle - (6*minutes) + (0.5*minutes)) # in 1min minute hand moves 6 degrees and hour moves 0.5 degrees

print(req_angle)

# here you will get smaller anlge so to get bigger angle subtract it with 360.
